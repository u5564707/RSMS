Research Sample Management System

The Research Sample Management System is a quick and easy way to enter, control and navigate samples and processes in scientific research. Data can be viewed, created, edited, deleted and processed into new sample sets.

## Installation
1. Click the green "Clone or download" button at the top of this page and download as a zip file.

2. Firstly, unzip the package, then download [the normal version of nw.js](http://nwjs.io) and copy the files inside the normal version into the RSMS folder.
    
3. Run the application by double clicking nwjs.

## Features

The user interface contains two main components, the tree shows the process branch and the table shows the data stored in the node.

#### View samples

In the tree structure, by right clicking on a node and selecting "View samples", the data stored in this node will show up in the table.

#### Edit sample data

After the table is shown, data can be added and edited by creating new rows and adding new columns, editing any cell and deleting the row data using the buttons available.

#### Create a new process

In the current version, the user only can create new process data from the root node. This is done by right clicking on the root node, then clicking "Process samples". Select the samples to process by entering comma-separated id values in the first dialog box that appears and enter the process name in the second box. A new node will appear with the sample ids entered and new columns and data can be entered and edited as per usual.
